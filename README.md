# JavaScriptInWasm
compile js in wasm 
# Objective
To implement a compiler with a syntax similar to JavaScript in Rust that supports compiling to high-performance WebAssembly (Wasm) execution

# general steps

* Language parsing: Design and implement a parser in Rust that can recognize and understand the syntax of JavaScript-like code.

* Abstract Syntax Tree (AST): Create an Abstract Syntax Tree representation of the parsed code. This data structure will capture the structure and semantics of the code.

* Semantic analysis: Implement semantic analysis routines to perform type checking, variable scoping, and other necessary checks on the AST.

* Code generation: Generate Wasm code from the validated AST. Rust provides libraries like wasm-bindgen or wasmer that can assist in this step.

* Optimization: Apply optimizations to the generated Wasm code to improve its performance. Rust's powerful ecosystem and compiler optimizations can help in this regard.

* Integration and runtime: Provide a runtime environment that can execute the generated Wasm code. Rust has various WebAssembly runtime libraries, such as wasmtime or wasmer, that can be utilized for this purpose.

*  By following these steps and leveraging Rust's strong ecosystem, you can build a Rust-based compiler that supports a JavaScript-like syntax and compiles to high-performance Wasm for efficient execution.
